<h1>Lab 1: Timing Leak</h1>

<div>Create a program to crack the password of a server that leaks information via a timing side-channel. Your submission should be only a modified crackPassword.js file. <b>Do not submit .zip files</b> or anything else, or you will receive 0 (but you can re-submit).</div>

<div>The password server program is a simple server that checks a provided password letter by letter, and gives up when it sees a match. It has an extra sleep() in between each letter to make the timing differences extra obvious.</div>

<div>The point of this lab is to learn about side-channel attacks, and to get some practice with writing javascript code that uses async/await.</div>

<ul>
  <li>Download the files <a href="passwordServer.js">passwordServer.js</a> and <a href="crackPassword.js">crackPassword.js</a>.</li>
  <li>
    Install the npm dependencies:
    <pre>npm install express node-fetch</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Start the password server:
    <pre>node passwordServer.js</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    In a separate window, run the crack password program:
    <pre>node crackPassword.js</pre>
    It will guess each letter of the alphabet as the password. See if any particular letter takes longer than others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit the crackPassword.js and write code to figure out the password.
  </li>
</ul>
